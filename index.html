                    <p class="story-paragraph">
                        So many great things, expected of me, but what do I see, when I take a glance, in the mirror you ask? Hopeless potential, contradicting I know. But as I go through the journey of this life I aspire to lead, I recognize all the mess I expected me to be. Whether in my career or in my friends. I feel alone, and constantly afraid of the unknown. I would like to have success, but what does that really mean? They have the materials I’d like to obtain, a well-known name, of course the fame. So that's success, well I guess.
                        But my reality is I’ll probably never be like those I see, but do I even wanna be? Gotta recap, let's think.
                        Happiness, the real success, that's what I had to discover.
                        For me to get those degrees; marriage, become a father to be, etc. So what does it mean, for me to succeed? Don't know if I've got it all figured. I honestly doubt it, but I know now that simplicity is what I seek. For me to be "me" to live life happily.
                        So will I ever be rich? Probably not, but who knows. Let's see how it goes, but until then my expectations will be my own set goals instead of those expected of me on the outside looking in.     -Prashant

                    <p class="story-paragraph">
                        These days, I feel like
                        I’m being controlled by someone else.
                        I mean I have lost control over myself
                        That’s not who I am that’s somebody else.
                        I used to have fixed routines
                        My own way of life, my own world.
                        But these days it seems like a new world
                        A world where only I’m dim others are bold.
                        Why am I unable to figure out?
                        What’s the reason? Why I’m lost?
                        I feel like I’m trapped inside a cupboard
                        Can’t breathe & my lungs are about to burst.
                        I feel suffocated to be myself
                        I’m tired of being who I am now
                        I want a change, I want to be myself
                        And I want to break free no matter how.
