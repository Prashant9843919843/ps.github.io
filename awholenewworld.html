                        That was an evil day for me. I could barely see the sun even in the mid noon. Black Dark clouds were all over the sky. 
                        I and my mom had to go to a party that day, while my mood was to stay and sleep in home. But I couldn’t get over my mom so I had to go anyway. 
                        We got into the bus and went through. The destination was just a few kilometres away and the road was very familiar to me. As everything was 
                        strange that day I found another thing strange and I was quite annoyed with my memory and myself. While the bus was moving I was constantly 
                        staring outside and none of the visuals I saw was familiar to me. I saw everything outside the window strange and new. I told my mom that what
                         place is this? She then shouted me back not to mess around her again. Her anger was justifiable as that road was the same road by which I used 
                         to travel to my school. <br> <br>
                        After a few moments, I again encountered a very strange road. The road was ecliptically vertical. 
                        I mean it wasn’t just a turn or a straight road either. Suddenly our bus fell down from the road and I don’t know what happened next.
                         I felt like we were in the different dimension of the earth where only I and this certain lady were alive. I don’t know how she looked.
                          I never saw her face. And she barely uttered a word. I was shouting and screaming but she was silent and just walking with me wherever I go. 
                          Few moments letter I found myself in a restaurant or a dinner hall or something like that. I saw many round tables where people were sitting around.
                          <br> <br> The strange part is that none of them were moving, they were stir like a statue. I thoroughly looked around the place and as far 
                          as I remember there were no exits. I felt it was like a dark hole as we’ve got explanations in school. The only different thing is the whole 
                          area was white actually. I nearly had a panic attack walking here and there searching for an exit but I wasn’t able to find one. I started to 
                          run and it seems my run wasn’t gonna end. As I move forward I could see more round table and stir people around me and that was like loop whole 
                          which was never ending. And no matter how hard I try to remember, 	I couldn’t picturize faces of any of those people. 
                          It was like walking among the dead.
                      <br><br>  I still continued running and suddenly my foot fell down as there was a stair and I felt I am falling from a very tall cliff and suddenly 
                      I felt someone stabbed in my back. And as I closed and opened my eyes and BOOOM! My mom was trying to get me down from the bus as I was busy in
                       my dreams. Then we got to the party and it’s over.
