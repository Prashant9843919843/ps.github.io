                        Killer eyes, perfect lips, a sweet smile with a dimple and long hair. Yes, that’s my girl. 
                        My girl with a sweet voice and a profound behaviour. She is that kind of girl whom every boy wants to 
                        marry but luckily she is mine and my fellow brothers can only dream of her. <br> <br>

                        Couple of years back that elegant beauty came into my life. It was a beautiful summer 
                        morning, her shine totally faded away the sun shine as she was the most beautiful object or 
                        let’s say most beautiful matter of this universe. It was like icing in the cake when wind blew and 
                        her hair covered her face. The way she pushed the hair back to her ear, oh damn! I have no words to 
                        explain that. That was testimonial. <br> <br>
                        
                        Suddenly I lost her view, it was like a dusk for me. My heart started to beat fast, I was anxious and 
                        I walked here and there searching for her. Unfortunately I didn’t find her. Later I felt stupid as I was
                         being anxious for the girl whom I met just a moment ago. I consoled myself as it’s just an infatuation and nothing else. <br> <br>
                        
                        The day passed with me consoling myself but the tough time was yet to come. In the dark night 
                        I started visualizing of her face and the and the moment I had earlier in the same day. I was 
                        thinking of her the whole night. Days and nights passed and it’s been a year since the first and 
                        last time I saw her.  In my imagination, I had already proposed her and we were an ideal couple. 
                        And that very day was our one year anniversary. It may sound crazy but it is what it is and I bet 
                        you won’t understand me. <br> <br>
                        
                        Now it’s been two years, the very day while I am writing this crazy stuffs. There’s still no trace 
                        of her. I probably had moved out earlier but it’s her beautiful smile, that’s stopping me to move on. <br> <br>
                        I guess it’s the only fun to be in one sided love.
