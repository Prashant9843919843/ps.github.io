                      Life is hard. <br> You try your everything to  make your near ones happy but somewhereyou forget  yourself. You try to take care of 
                      the people around you, you try to please them and make them happy. In that rush or let's say tension, you totally forget what you want
                      and what makes you happy. <br>
                      Be honest and ask yourself a question, when was the last time you tried to do something for yourself? When was the lad time you spent with yourself figuring
                      out your strength and weaknesses, your likes and dislikes. <br>
                      People often says, human beings are selfish, ask yourself are you selfish? If you don't remember when was the last time you actually took care of yourself
                      then congratulations you aren't selfish. But if you rmemebr then sorry you're selfish. <br>
                      In in this case I have s=no shame in saying that I am selfish. <br> why? 
                      <br> Because if I don't take care of myself the  who else will? If I don't know myself then who else will recognize me? For me to be succesful one day Ii need 
                      to know my strengths and weaknesses.   
                      <br> Now let's move to the begining. You're tired of pleasing your closed ones but it isn't happening. try taking care of yourself first. If you are 
                      happy then only you can make people around you happy. And for that you have to take care of yourself. <br>
                      Have you ever seen a standup comedian sad or crying in the stage, not in the act I mean literally? Answer is no. Comedians always come with positive aura and happy vibes
                      even though their jokes aren't funny enough they try to make us laugh whislist they themself being happy. So, firstof all please yourself, make yourself happy, then only think
                      about others.
