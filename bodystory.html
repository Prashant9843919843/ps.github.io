                        I am not the problem, problem is my body. I am not the one who ask those creeps to check me out. It’s my body who keeps attracting those freaks. 
                        Do they care? Do they feel shame? Oh! No, no, I am the only one who have to be ashamed. Why? Because it has to be my basic quality. I was born with it. 
                        They treat their siblings differently, with respect and with love. But it’s because of my body they treat me different. And Why not they should be treating me like that? I wear short dresses and they are the great one who punish me by staring at me, teasing me and touching my body even I am not comfortable with it. Even if I wear decent clothes, they’ll punish me whatsoever. Why? Because it’s my body who keeps attracting them. Problem is my body anyways. 
                        I heard they had done worst to the same kind like me. Some died, some were killed. And it’s only because of their body that they had to loss their 
                        dignity, their life and everything. Why because of their body. They even punish small and the old ones too. We kept attracting those demons and that’s 
                        why we were punished. If we weren’t ready to be punished then they’ll wash off our face and even try to kill us. They’ll always want us to be their whore.
                        I kept thinking why are we being punished? Is it because of my short dress? If that is so then the old one wouldn’t have been 
                         punished. If it’s because of my puffed chest or my puffed back then newly born ones wouldn’t have been punished either. Is it only because of my body? 
                         If that is so then it would be better to learn controlling my body, would be even better to change my mentality, change the way to see the world. 
                         And would be even better if I learn to RESPECT.
