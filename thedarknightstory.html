        The Dark Night
       </h1>
       <p class="story-paragraph">
        In the cold shivering early evening, I was still in the bus stop waiting for my bus to go home. I got to my town’s bus stop 
        lately around 8 in the evening and I had to walk further two and a half kilometres to reach home. I didn’t had any flashlight 
        or a smart phone either. After jumping from bus I continued walking towards home with fear and in a hurry.
        In my way home there’s a mortuary. I was so scared to pass that place. <br> <br> So, I ran before mortuary block started. 
        Just in front of the mortuary I got stuck in a stone and fell down miserably. And after falling I heard someone screaming, 
        “Hey!” “Hey!” I ignored that and started to run again but I felt that someone was pulling me grabbing my backpack. I was so 
               frightened that I left the backpack and ran to my home. <br> <br> After reaching home, I was calm and relaxed. Mom was asking me 
               about my backpack, but I didn’t uttered a single word about that incident and how I left the backpack in the middle of 
               the road. So like normal days I had my dinner and went to bed. <br> <br> The very next day, I woke up and I found my 
               backpack just in front of my door. I was so scared and I ran to mom asking why is that backpack there. Mom furiously 
               told me that neighbour uncle was shouting for me the other day and he found that backpack in the road so he brought that 
               home. It was late so he decided not to bother us.
       After hearing to mom I was quite shocked and felt stupid as well. My backpack was actually stuck in the divider of the 
       road and after hearing “hey!” “Hey!” I was scared more so I left my backpack there. <br> <br>
       Fear is nothing but just our imaginations. So, don’t fear, keep calm.
